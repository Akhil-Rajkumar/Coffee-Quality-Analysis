# Coffee-Quality-Analysis
Business Intelligence project analyzing sensory drivers of product quality using the CQI Arabica dataset

# Business Intelligence & Market Driver Analysis: Specialty Coffee Case Study

## Project Overview
This project identifies the primary sensory drivers of high-tier product quality using a dataset of 1,000+ Arabica coffee evaluations. The goal was to translate raw sensory scores into actionable business benchmarks for product positioning.

## Key Insights
* **Primary Drivers:** Identified that **Flavor and Aftertaste (r=0.84)** are the strongest predictors of elite-tier ratings.
* **Market Benchmarking:** Discovered a significant market saturation point in the **82–84 point range**, identifying the statistical barrier to "Outstanding" status.
* **Data Integrity:** Engineered a cleanup pipeline to resolve structural inconsistencies and non-English entries in geographic metadata.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Methodology:** Multivariate Correlation, KDE Distribution Modeling, Data Aggregation (GroupBys).
